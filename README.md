## üåê Frontend Integration

### Run React Frontend

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd dao-frontend

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Wallet Connection

1. Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension
2. Connect to local network (localhost:8545)
3. Import accounts from Hardhat node output
4. Connect wallet in the DApp interface

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Deployment

```bash
# 1. Start local node
npx hardhat node

# 2. Deploy contracts (in new terminal)
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Governance.ts --network localhost

# 3. Update frontend config
# Edit dao-frontend/src/config/contracts.ts with deployed addresses

# 4. Run frontend
cd dao-frontend
npm run dev
```

### Testnet Deployment (Sepolia/Goerli)

<details>
<summary>Click for testnet deployment instructions</summary>

```bash
# 1. Add network configuration to hardhat.config.ts
# networks: {
#   sepolia: {
#     url: "https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_KEY",
#     accounts: [PRIVATE_KEY]
#   }
# }

# 2. Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Governance.ts --network sepolia

# 3. Verify contracts on Etherscan
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```

</details>

## ‚úÖ Usage Guide

### Proposal Creation Flow

```tsx
// Example: Creating a proposal with metadata
const targets = [treasuryAddress];
const values = [0n];
const calldata = treasuryInterface.encodeFunctionData("releaseETH", [
  recipientAddress,
  ethers.parseEther("1")
]);
const title = "Release 1 ETH to Community Fund";
const description = "Proposal to release 1 ETH to the community fund for development grants";
const ipfsCID = "QmExampleCID";
const category = 1; // Protocol category

await governor.proposeWithMetadata(
  targets,
  values,
  [calldata],
  title,
  description,
  ipfsCID,
  category
);
```

### Voting Process

```tsx
// Delegate voting power
await token.delegate(walletAddress);

// Vote on proposal
await governor.castVote(proposalId, 1); // 1 = For, 0 = Against, 2 = Abstain
```

### Proposal Execution

```tsx
// Queue proposal after voting period
await governor.queue(targets, values, [calldata], descriptionHash);

// Execute after timelock delay
await governor.execute(targets, values, [calldata], descriptionHash);
```
