# Production Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Requirements

### 1. Security Audits
- [ ] Third-party security audit completed
- [ ] All critical and high-severity issues resolved
- [ ] Formal verification performed on critical functions
- [ ] Fuzz testing completed with sufficient coverage
- [ ] Bug bounty program established

### 2. Testing
- [ ] Unit test coverage â‰¥ 90%
- [ ] Integration tests for all critical user flows
- [ ] End-to-end tests for proposal lifecycle
- [ ] Load/stress testing for high-traffic scenarios
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility testing

### 3. Documentation

- [ ] User guides for DAO participants
- [ ] Governance process documentation
- [ ] Emergency procedures documentation
- [ ] API documentation for frontend integration

## Recommended Governance Parameters

### Mainnet Parameters
- **Voting Delay**: 1 day (7,200 blocks)
- **Voting Period**: 7 days (50,400 blocks)
- **Proposal Threshold**: 10,000 tokens (1% of total supply)
- **Quorum**: 4% of total token supply
- **Timelock Delay**: 2 days (172,800 seconds)
- **Guardian Role**: Multisig wallet (3/5 or 4/7)

### Rationale
- Longer voting periods allow for global participation
- Higher proposal thresholds prevent spam
- Balanced quorum ensures sufficient participation
- Timelock provides time for community review
- Multisig guardian prevents single point of failure

## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Contract Deployment
1. Deploy to mainnet using deterministic addresses
2. Verify all contracts on Etherscan
3. Transfer ownership to TimelockController
4. Configure role assignments
5. Set guardian roles

### 2. Frontend Deployment
1. Build production version: `npm run build`
2. Deploy to IPFS/Arweave for decentralization
3. Configure ENS domain
4. Set up CDN for performance
5. Implement monitoring and analytics

### 3. Monitoring Setup

#### The Graph Integration
1. Create subgraph for DAO contracts
2. Index key events:
   - ProposalCreated
   - VoteCast
   - ProposalExecuted
   - Token transfers
   - Membership changes
3. Deploy subgraph to hosted service

#### Tenderly Integration
1. Set up Tenderly dashboard
2. Configure alerts for:
   - Failed transactions
   - Large token transfers
   - Emergency pause events
   - Governance actions
3. Implement webhook notifications

#### Custom Monitoring
1. Set up Prometheus/Grafana for:
   - Proposal statistics
   - Voting participation rates
   - Treasury balance changes
   - Contract interaction metrics
2. Implement alerting for anomalies

## Backup and Recovery Plan

### 1. Data Backup
- [ ] Regular snapshots of contract state
